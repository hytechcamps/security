# Notes 5/17

## Structure

### Icebreaker


### Lecture
- vpn (what it looks like) (encrypted tunnel)
- cloud / network / internet of things
- aws (amazon) - lots of services use the infrastructure, could take down half the world
- internet of things - how we connect (like zoom), smart tvs, wise cameras, refrigerators
- stuff at work - ???
- fileshare access
- NFTs hacking - $625 mil taken from (axi infinity)
- axi infinity like pokemon but characters are worth a lot of money

#### 5/17/22
- resident IT as teenager - topics like proper hygiene to mitigate risk - phishing, emails
- real life stuff - scam calls, clear browser history, virus scan
    - kids might know already, but important to touch on
    - something they can take back to family, make it a practice
- VPN = good ways to secure internet traffic, IoT devices
- Account security, not using the same password, turning on 2FA/MFA, password managers (ex LastPass)
    - iPhone has a password manager - Keychain works well on Mac/iPhone
    - don't have to think about clever passwords - 72 characters
    - subtopic: have i been pwned - look up phone numbers/emails that have been part of breaches
    - Google Chrome / iPhone both have warnings for compromised/reused passwords (probably something similar with Android devices)
- importance of relating it to real life examples
- virus scans - need antivirus, windows has defender - built-in scanning service
    - trial version of avast or whatever, it can expire and they will just want money
    - best way to go is just free
- gateway and router security - make sure firmware is patched, not using default password
    - can change/obfuscate SSID, turn off broadcasting for it
- access control list stuff - as opposed to just entered SSID/pass, it does it by MAC address
- vulnerable firmware on routers (like netgear, asus) - fbi found it and were seeing some exploitation through foreign countries - vendors were dragging their feet - fbi pushed out a patch to all affected devices
- stress importance of changing default password to router - usually "admin/admin" or something
    - friend could get in and have full access to everything

could maybe reuse some of the security awareness training for Hyland

### Formative Assessment


### Interactive Activity
- decoding something
- searching for indicator of compromise
- phishing - obfuscated web urls
- cyberchef

#### 5/17
- verifying a link or software to install - use urlscan.io, virustotal.com, hybrid analysis, showdan, maltiverse
- ad blocker
- toaster notifications built into windows - seeing a lot of fake ones (through browser but interfaces with windows)
- most common is through a browser - knowing how to clear out history
    - good idea to pass on to family
- reset browser to factory defaults
